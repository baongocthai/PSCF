# PSCF
Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) using openair package in R for source apportionment
Data required:
- back trajectory: in this script, results from Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model 
- concentration data: int this script, results from Postivitive Matrix Factorization (PMF) for source apportionment

PSCF helps to give some indication on the locations of transported pollutants
To give indications on the locations of local emission sources, PSCF might not be suitable - polar contour (surface windrose + concentration weighted) might be more appropriate
